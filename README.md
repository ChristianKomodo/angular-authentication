# AngularJS Authentication
Registration and authentication in AngularJS using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [AngularFire](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire).

*Success* page is protected from unauthenticated users.

Uses "three way data binding" from Firebase on the Success page - when you change the data in the Firebase database, it is reflected immediately in the view.
